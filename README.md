The _Talent Roster_ is an online list of student profiles to facilitate
connections with potential employers.

## Development

This is a Django project with one application, using a Python 3 environment
managed by venv and [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv). After you
clone this repository, `cd` into the repo root and:

`python -m venv .`

Next, activate the environment:

`source bin/activate`

Now install [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) pipenv:

`pip install pipenv`

From here on out, you will use `pipenv` to install all dependencies. Do it now:

`pipenv install`

This will install the dependencies listed in _Pipfile.lock_.
